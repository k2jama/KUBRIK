## Requirement Analysis:
The product should be a platform that automates the generation of hyperrealistic video advertisements using GANs. It should have a user-friendly web-based UI for inputting the required elements of the video ads. The platform should generate prototypes for ad elements like products, characters, and settings using specialized GANs. The generated prototypes should be reviewed and approved or sent back for revisions by human reviewers. Key frames should be generated based on the plot and storyboard, and smooth video frames should be generated between key frames for a seamless viewing experience. The platform should ensure that each frame meets advertising, marketing, and cinematography best practices through quality control. Finally, the platform should produce the finalized hyperrealistic video ads in the desired format and resolution.

## Requirement Pool:
```python
[
    ("Develop a user-friendly web-based UI for inputting required elements", "P0"),
    ("Generate prototypes for ad elements using specialized GANs", "P0"),
    ("Implement a review and approval system for prototypes", "P1"),
    ("Generate key frames based on the plot and storyboard", "P0"),
    ("Generate smooth video frames between key frames", "P0")
]
```

## UI Design draft:
The UI should have a clean and intuitive design. It should include input fields for specifying the required elements of the video ads, such as products, characters, and settings. There should be a preview area where users can see the generated prototypes and key frames. The UI should also have buttons for approving or sending back prototypes for revisions. Additionally, there should be options for selecting the desired format and resolution of the finalized video ads. The layout should be responsive and adaptable to different screen sizes.

## Anything UNCLEAR:
There are no unclear points.
