## Logic Analysis:

```python
[
    ("main.py", "UI"),
    ("ui.py", "UI"),
    ("prototype_generator.py", "PrototypeGenerator"),
    ("review_system.py", "ReviewSystem"),
    ("key_frame_generator.py", "KeyFrameGenerator"),
    ("frame_generator.py", "FrameGenerator"),
    ("quality_control.py", "QualityControl"),
    ("video_production.py", "VideoProduction"),
    ("deployment.py", "Deployment")
]
```

The logic analysis shows the dependencies between the files. The tasks should be done in the following order:

1. `main.py` - Implements the main entry point and orchestrates the flow of the program.
2. `ui.py` - Implements the user interface for inputting elements, displaying prototypes, key frames, and video frames, and selecting video format and resolution.
3. `prototype_generator.py` - Implements the prototype generation logic based on the input elements.
4. `review_system.py` - Implements the review and approval system for prototypes.
5. `key_frame_generator.py` - Implements the key frame generation logic based on the plot and storyboard.
6. `frame_generator.py` - Implements the frame-by-frame generation logic for smooth video frames.
7. `quality_control.py` - Implements the quality control system for checking frame quality.
8. `video_production.py` - Implements the video production logic for producing the finalized hyperrealistic video ads.
9. `deployment.py` - Implements the deployment logic for deploying the system on a scalable infrastructure.

## Task list:

```python
[
    "main.py",
    "ui.py",
    "prototype_generator.py",
    "review_system.py",
    "key_frame_generator.py",
    "frame_generator.py",
    "quality_control.py",
    "video_production.py",
    "deployment.py"
]
```
